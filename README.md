PDX Tools is a modern [EU4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Universalis_IV) save file analyzer that allow users to view maps, graphs, and data tables of their save all within the browser. If the user desires, they can upload the save and share it with the world, while also being elibigle to compete in achievement speedrun leaderboards.

PDX Tools has a modular structure and can be expanded to handle any game. Currently [CK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_III), [HOI4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Iron_IV), [Victoria 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_3), and [Imperator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperator:_Rome) saves can also be analyzed, though functionality is limited to just melting (conversion of a binary save to plaintext).

## Contributor Guide

If you'd like to contribute, you've come to the right place! This README should hopefully get you started on your journey. If you get stuck or have a bug report you can [file it here](issues) or chat about it [on the discord](https://discord.gg/rCpNWQW)

The best way to get started contributing is to use the [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) setup with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (vscode), as it will handle juggling all the system dependencies to ensure your environment matches others. Alternatively, there are instructions for a [manual dev environment](#manual-build-environment) that is less well tested.

To get started with Dev Containers, there is an [official vscode installation guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_installation) that will have you download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and the [vscode remote development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

Couple of important notes for the installation:

- A Linux Docker host is recommended as it has better support and performance, though Windows and Mac hosts can narrow the performance gap if the PDX Tools repo is [cloned in a container volume](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance#_use-clone-repository-in-container-volume)
- On Linux, prefer installing [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) over Docker desktop

After Docker and vscode have been installed with the remote development plugin added to vscode, installation can continue:

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/pdx-tools/pdx-tools.git

# open the repo in vscode
code pdx-tools
```

Once the repo is open in vscode, either click the tooltip to open in Dev Container or [open manually](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial#_check-installation)

The next step is deciding on how to communicate EU4 assets during the compilation stage, as Paradox would be unhappy if the game assets were uploaded to the repo. There are a couple ways of doing this:

- If you're comfortable with docker, modify the docker mounts in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to include the directory where EU4 is installed. Below is an example:
  ```diff
  -    "source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock,type=bind"
  +    "source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock,type=bind",
  +    "source=${localEnv:HOME}/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Europa Universalis IV,target=/tmp/eu4,type=bind,consistency=cached,readonly"
  ```
  After saving, reload the project. You know it's successful once `/tmp/eu4` is visible within the container terminal.
- Alternatively, copy the entire EU4 installation into the cloned directory

Now let's process the EU4 into digestible chunks. In a terminal inside vscode, execute:

```bash
just pdx create-bundle "/tmp/eu4" assets/game-bundles

# The above command outputs a versioned eu4 bundle. In this case 1.34
just pdx compile-assets assets/game-bundles/eu4-1.34.tar.zst
```

After those commands have finished, one can unlink the EU4 assets if desired.

Then, to start the PDX Tools:

```bash
just dev
```

This will start the web server on two ports: 3001 and 3003. 3001 is plain HTTP and 3003 is HTTPS with a self signed certificate. Since some web features like brotli decoding only work over HTTPS in firefox, it is recommended to use the HTTPS endpoint.

Congrats! You should now be able to see PDX Tools in your browser and be able to parse non-ironman saves.

### Ironman saves

By default, ironman and binary files will be unparsable. If you are in possession of a binary token file, you can unlock processing binary saves by placing the the token file at `./assets/tokens/eu4.txt` and execute:

```bash
just tokenize --eu4-ironman-tokens ./assets/tokens/eu4.txt
```

## Contributor Project Guide

A quick intro into how the repo is structured.

- **app**: The main project directory, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. This is where the API, frontend UI, and the bulk of the code live.
- **applib**: Rust library that contains code shared between CLI clients and the backend of the app.
- **applib-node**: [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#node-api) bindings for app backend to access Rust computations at native speed.
- **blog**: blog contents
- **cli**: CLI used for asset, admin, and user commands
- **eu4game**: Rust library for computing EU4 achievements and for exposing information only found in game files.
- **map**: Project that contains the WebGL2 map shaders and logic for interacting with shaders. It is a standalone module, so that contributors can quickly iterate on shader and WebGL2 implementations without instantiating a dev environment.
- **schemas**: flatbuffer schema for communicating game data efficiently to the browser
- **tarsave**: Utility crate that detects if a eu4 save file has been converted into a tarsave. A tarsave, much like it sounds, is a [tarball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) with every file from a zip transferred into the archive. Tarsaves allow us to transfer the save over the network with a content encoding that can leverage the browser's natively implemented brotli decompression engine, which is faster at inflating than our Wasm zip decompression while having a much better compression ratio.   
- **wasm-compress**: Wasm package that compresses uncompressed uploads
- **wasm-{{game}}**: Wasm packages dedicated to translating the Rust logic into a Wasm (ie: browser) environment. Each game is a separate package so that users don't need to pay the cost of downloading the logic for every game if they only ever analzye one game.

## Manual Build Environment

If not using vscode and the Dev Container, one can setup an environment manually.

A Linux environment assumed (WSL on Windows untested but probably supported). The following applications must be installed in order to instantiate the dev environment.

- docker
- docker-compose
- node js
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) with the `convert` command in `$PATH`
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just/releases/latest)

Once the above dependencies are installed, the remaining dependencies can be installed with:

```bash
just setup
```
